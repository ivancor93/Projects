## Scenario
 > Scenario : Business Intelligence Consultant and Analyst for a company that manages real estate (Illustrations are on their original presentation and language)
> 
 > Software tool : Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook)
>
 > Applied techniques : linear regression, clustering, libraries (Matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, pandas), applying r square error, detecting anomalies

## Missions
> * Understand business needs
> * Explore data files and analyze the evolution of real estate prices
> * Establish a linear regression to predict real estate values and explain the methodology used
> * Automatically classify asset purchase opportunities

>   Picture 1 : Creating a graph to visualize the increase in the average price of real estate
